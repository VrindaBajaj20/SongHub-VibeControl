# **SongHub VibeControl**

**SongHub VibeControl** is an innovative music control system that leverages gesture recognition, voice commands, and mood-based analysis to enhance the way you interact with music. This project integrates state-of-the-art AI models and techniques to provide a seamless, intuitive user experience that allows users to control and personalize their music playback without lifting a finger.

## **Features**

- **Gesture-Based Control**: Using machine learning models, users can control music playback through hand gestures. With a camera, the system detects and interprets predefined gestures to pause, play, skip, and control volume, providing hands-free interaction with music.

- **Voice Command Integration**: Voice recognition is incorporated into the system, enabling users to control music through voice commands. Commands like "play," "pause," "next," "previous," and "volume up" are supported, offering an intuitive hands-free music experience.

- **Mood Detection**: The project uses mood analysis to tailor the music selection to the user’s emotional state. By detecting facial expressions and voice tone, the system adjusts the music playlist to match the user's current mood, enhancing the overall listening experience.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time gesture and face recognition, enabling gesture-based control.
- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for training machine learning models, including hand gesture recognition.
- **Speech Recognition**: For voice command detection and interpretation.
- **dlib**: For facial emotion detection and mood analysis through facial expressions.
- **PyAudio**: For capturing and processing voice commands in real-time.
- **Flask**: Used to serve the system’s front-end web interface, making it accessible on any browser.
- **NumPy** & **Pandas**: For data handling and processing during machine learning training.
